\title{Determines which regulatory regions are signifigantly altered
between sample types}
\usage{
countanalysis(counts, pval = 0.01, lfcvalue = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{counts}{counts for each region}

\item{pval}{optional, pvalue considered significant (0.05, 0.01, etc.)}

\item{lfcvalue}{optional, logfold change value considered significant
(value reported on a log scale base 2 so log2fold change of 1.5 means
difference in peaks increased by 2^1.5 or 2.8)}
}
\value{
list containing:
1) DESeq2 results table
2) some statistics
3) data.frame used for plotting
}
\description{
Altered regions are those that show differences in chromatin accessibility
(using DESeq2 algorithm)
}

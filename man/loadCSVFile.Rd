\description{
The metadata associated with data files to be analyzed in ALTRE is supplied
as a CSV file. The software will automatically retrieve the file path of
input CSV so it is important that all analysis files are in the same folder
as CSV file. If there are greater than two sample types in the file,
two samples must be selected for analysis using the paramaters sample1 and
sample2. This software can only compare two samples at a time.

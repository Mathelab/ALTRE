\title{Given a GRangeslist object with peaks for each samples, determine
the consensus peaks (found in at least N replicates, where N is input
 by the user) for each sample type}
\usage{
getConsensusPeaks(samplepeaks, minreps)
}
\arguments{
\item{samplepeaks}{A GRangesList object comprising one GRanges object (peaks)
for each sample (output of loadBEDFiles() function)}

\item{minreps}{minimum number of replicate samples that a peak should be
contained in to be called as a consensus peak. This cutoff will be
 applied to both samples.}
}
\value{
a list comprising:
1) a GRangeslist with one GRange for each sample type
 which contains consensus peaks
2) a summary statistic table
}

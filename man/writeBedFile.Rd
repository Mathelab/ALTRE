\title{Creates a custom track for visualization on genome browser}
\usage{
writeBedFile(analysisresults, con)
}
\arguments{
\item{analysisresults}{output generated from categAltrePeaks()}

}
\description{
Creates a color-coded BED file for visualization of peaks and their ALTRE
categories in a genome browser: red indicates increased log2fold change/low
p-value, blue indicates decreased lod2fold change/low p-value, and purple
indicates regions with little to no change and insignificant p-values.
Based on the log2fold change and p-value inputs, there is a possibility that
some regions will not fulfill any of the supplied criteria
("in-between" shared and type-specific). They are colored grey.
